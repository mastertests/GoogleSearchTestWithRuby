# GoogleSearchTest

Simple Google search test application. Nothing interesting? Sure, it should not be.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile, 'course if you want, but should not recommend to:

```ruby
gem 'GoogleSearchTest'
```

And then execute if you are lazy:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as if you are 'smart':

    $ gem install GoogleSearchTest
